          Hello, my name is Viktor and I am from Slovakia but currently living
          in Prague. I have been studying front-end web development on my own
          for more than a year at this moment, and in my opinion it is the right
          time to look for my first job connected to this field.
        </p>
        <p>
          I consider myself as a responsible person and I never had a problem
          with working hard and being flexible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a team-player but according to circumstances I am capable of
          working by myself as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am aware that my journey as a programmer is at the very beginning,
          but I am sure that my wish to become better and ability to learn fast
          will make me a good addition to your team.
