          Hello, my name is Viktor and I am from Slovakia. Currently, I am
          living in Prague. I have been studying front-end web development on my
          own for nearly 2 years, and I believe that the time has come for me to
          pursue job opportunities in this field.

          I consider myself as a responsible person and I never had a problem
          with working hard and being flexible.

          I am a team-player but according to circumstances I am capable of
          working by myself as well.

        <Paragraph>
          I am aware that my journey as a programmer is at the very beginning,
          but I am sure that my wish to become better and ability to learn fast
          will make me a good addition to your team.
